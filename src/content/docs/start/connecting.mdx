import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Now you have your credentials, with them you can connect to your project.

```js
// main.js
import ng from "newgrounds.js";

ng.connect("58164:B7EmpwFA", "5FQJE8pAE74+8Z+5ub4xiw==");
```

Now you are connected to your project starting a session. The session will
be used for get data of your game, and if the game is on Newgrounds, you also
have the user data.

<Aside type="note">
If your game is also avaible out of Newgrounds, you must authenticate the user,
you can learn how in the [Authentication guide](/docs/authentication).
