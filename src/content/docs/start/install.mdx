## NPM
import { PackageManagers } from "starlight-package-managers";

You can install Newgrounds.js using any of your favorite package managers

<PackageManagers pkg="newgrounds.js" pkgManagers={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn", "bun", "ni" ]}/>

```js
// main.js
import ng from "newgrounds.js";

// Connect to your project
await ng.connect("533327:b6GaR8Eb", "ivuwzsfewkq√±wacRQ==");

// Start using NG.io
await ng.unlockMedal(129521);
await ng.postScore(12052012, 50);
```

Also using this way you should build your project with a bundler like ESBuild
or Webpack. This way has some benefits like autocomplete (thanks to TypeScript),
minor bundle size, and tree shaking.

## CDN
If you prefer, you can also use a CDN to include  Newgrounds.js in your project.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/newgrounds.js/dist/newgrounds.js"></script>
```

```js
// main.js
// Then use it with the ng object

ng.connect();
ng.unlockMedal(129521);
ng.postScore(12052012, 50);
```
