Some actions related to the user like unlocking medals, post scores or saving
data require the user to be authenticated. Usually if your game only runs on
Newgrounds, this is not a problem, but if you want to run your game on other
site, you need to authenticate the user.

## Authenticating the user

Newgrounds.js provides a method to authenticate the user. This method will open
a new window where the user can log in or create an account.

```js
login();
```

After the user has logged in, you can check if the user is authenticated with
the `isLoggedIn` method.

```js
isLoggedIn(); // true or false
```
